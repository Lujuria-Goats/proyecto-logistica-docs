# Java Microservice: Route Optimizer

This microservice acts as the intelligent core of our logistics platform, dedicated to solving combinatorial optimization problems. It specifically implements the **Nearest Neighbor (NN)** algorithm to calculate efficient delivery routes.

Here you will find detailed technical specifications regarding the mathematical logic applied and the internal APIs available for integration.
